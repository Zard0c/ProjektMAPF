# Summary

This directory contains both two types of encodings, with the A (actually B) Domain code building on the fundament of the M-Domain code, as well as the shell scripts for creating and loading plans. We also present our recorded runtimes and a folder containing a collection of scrapped ideas or outdated code.

As it stands, work on the M-Domain is finished for the time being, with all our attention now focused on working out the kinks of the B-Domain specific encodings. Runtimes of the B-Domain code will follow shortly.
