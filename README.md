# README
This repository contains the files of the MAPF project, short for Multiple Agent Path-Finding, part of the University of Potsdam course "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning".

It is split between our encodings, the basics of which were taken from the Asprilo seminar (also offered by the University of Potsdam) and then modified to suit our needs, the list of benchmarks we use to test our code and a bash script to quickly create and run our benchmarks. Details concerning our benchmarks can be found in the 'benchmarks' folder, those concerning our work on the encodings in the 'encodings' folder. Lastly, a developers diary is currently in development.

# TODO
Insert explanation of shell script here
