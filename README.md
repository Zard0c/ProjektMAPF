# README
This repository contains the files of the MAPF project, short for Multiple Agent Path-Finding, part of the University of Potsdam course "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning".

It is split between our encodings, the basics of which were taken from the Asprilo seminar( also offered by the University of Potsdam) and then modified to suit our needs, and the list of benchmarks we use to test our code. Currently there are 5 benchmarks made by our group and 3 taken from other project groups for their uniqueness, with the first 5 being the former and the last 3 being the latter.

Note: As a baseline, the prioritization of robots is based on their collision depth, derived from how many collisions they have already been involved in and in how many of them they were the one allowed to move (clearer explanation pending). The robot ID is used purely as a tie breaker.
