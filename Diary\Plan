current status of project: all but one benchmark is solvable, only straight tunnel continues to elude us
further, modifications(removal of col dept N in wait, frd, dodge and nmc) of the code (21.01.2021) vastly improved runtimes on all but 2 benchmarks
next objective: expand into the A domain
                  -create new benchmarks/modify old ones to include packing stations

quick summary of events so far: managed to merge plans without collision, struggled to merge plans with collisions (reason: missing variable for tracking col depth as 
unique identifier), added said modifier after Christmas holidays, added proper dodge commands, modified dodge commands for edge cases (robot finishes in regular path,
robot finishes in path of a dodge return), modified encoding to remove col depth from wait(), frd(), dodge() and nmc() and started taking calculation times
