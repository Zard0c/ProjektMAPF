   tom solved in CPU Time     : 0.107s with horizon 9(lot of filler movements, probably in 6)

m_b_17(B-Domain):
adrian unsatisfiable.
marcus solved in CPU Time     : 4.578s with horizon 15
niklas unsatisfiable.
tarik unsatisfiable.
tom unsatisfiable.
{conclusion, we are only one with greater power then M domain}
{also, niklas produced a solution, meaning the solver thinks that passing by the shelf fulfills goal condition}


n_b_5:
adrian unsatisfiable.
marcus was killed. (can be solved)
niklas solved in CPU Time     : 0.902s with horizon 12
 tarik solved in CPU Time     : 0.180s with horizon 17
   tom solved in CPU Time     : 0.309s with horizon 17? (lot of filler movement)

{tom passed the benchmark, but at end had one robot move away from shelf; so solver considers goal fulfilled, after reaching the shelf, and doesn't need to stay there}

n_b_6:
adrian solved in CPU Time     : 187.834s with horizon ?
marcus was killed. {expected unsat}
niklas solved in CPU Time     : 0.129s with horizon 9
 tarik solved in CPU Time     : 0.418s with horizon ? (r2 never reaches shelf)
 tom is unsatisfiable.

{instance broken? R2 behaves weird}

n_b_42:
adrian solved in CPU Time     : 6.442s with horizon 10

niklas was unsatisfiable. 
 tarik solved in CPU Time     : 0.047s with horizon 6
   tom solved in CPU Time     : 0.127s with horizon 10

{because of shelf numbering, leads to not be solvable in the expected horizon, as we expect r1 to go to s1, but the plan leads to s3}

horizon to low?
